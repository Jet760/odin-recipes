      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p id="description">This is Craig's mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, 
        made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
        A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but Craig's mom's recipe calls for a blend
        of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.
